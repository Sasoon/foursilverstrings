# Artwork information

<details markdown='1'><summary class="faq-container"><strong>Print Quality</strong></summary> 
All our artwork prints are giclée. They have the highest resolution and the sharpest detail. Giclée prints capture every shade, tone and colour of the original artwork. This is partly because standard printers use dye-based inks instead of pigment-based inks. Our prints, when stored or displayed in normal conditions, should last 100 years or more, so we think investing in giclée printing is the way to go.

<details markdown='1'><summary class="faq-container"><strong>Do the artworks come ready to hang?</strong></summary> 
Yes, all artworks come read to hang, no assembly is required upon receiving your artwork! It is however important to check the material of your wall and make sure you use the appropriate nail thickness and length, taking into consideration the weight of the artwork.
</details>  

<details markdown='1'><summary class="faq-container"><strong>Artwork and frame sizes</strong></summary> 
The size of the artwork itself will be exactly as you selected in your order (A4, A3, A2 etc). 
We source our frames from different places so the dimensions of the frames may vary ever so slightly with every order. However use the following as a rough guideline:

Frame weight:
A2: ~2.5kg
A3: ~2kg
A4: ~1.5kg

All frames will add roughly 3-5cm on each side.

<details markdown='1'><summary class="faq-container"><strong>Artwork care</strong></summary> 
All paper-based framed artworks have a Perspex protective cover. We don't use glass for safety reasons. Keep out of direct sunlight, and use a dry microfibre cloth to gently wipe any dust off of the frame and protective cover. 
</details>  

<details markdown='1'><summary class="faq-container"><strong>Original paintings</strong></summary> 
Some original paintings are for sale, however that may change at any time. We will still produce prints from that original, and own all rights to that painting.
