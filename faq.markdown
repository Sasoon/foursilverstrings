# Artwork information

<details markdown='1'><summary class="faq-container"><strong>Print Quality</strong></summary> 
All our artwork prints are giclée. They have the highest resolution and the sharpest detail. Giclée prints capture every shade, tone and colour of the original artwork. This is partly because standard printers use dye-based inks instead of pigment-based inks. Our prints, when stored or displayed in normal conditions, should last 100 years or more, so we think investing in giclée printing is the way to go.

<details markdown='1'><summary class="faq-container"><strong>Do the artworks come ready to hang?</strong></summary> 
Yes, all artworks come read to hang, no assembly is required upon receiving your artwork! It is however important to check the material of your wall and make sure you use the appropriate nail thickness and length, taking into consideration the weight of the artwork. This is generally not an issue but be wary of crumbling type materials or very thin walls.
</details>  

<details markdown='1'><summary class="faq-container"><strong>Artwork and frame sizes</strong></summary> 
The size of the artwork itself will be exactly as you selected in your order (A4, A3, A2 etc). 
We source our frames from different places so the dimensions of the frames may vary ever so slightly with every order. However it's a very small margin, and the approximate size and weight of an framed artwork is specified in the description of each individual artwork.
</details>  

<details markdown='1'><summary class="faq-container"><strong>Artwork care</strong></summary> 
All paper-based framed artworks have a Perspex protective cover. We don't use glass for safety reasons. Use a dry microfibre cloth to gently wipe any dust off of the frame and protective cover. 
</details>  

<details markdown='1'><summary class="faq-container"><strong>Original paintings</strong></summary> 
Some original paintings are for sale. However, that may change at any time and we do still use prints from that original, and own all creative and business rights to that painting.
</details>  

<details markdown='1'><summary class="faq-container"><strong>Moving on from an artwork</strong></summary> 
Some artworks are with us for life, some are like seasons and we grow out of them. If you are looking to replace one the artworks you bought from us, send it back to us (we will cover shipping costs). We'll donate it and send you a photo of the artwork's new home!
