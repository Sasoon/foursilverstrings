I've been playing violin since 1994 and teaching music since 2009. 
I started painting in 2011 and fell in love with the combination of both worlds. 

### The Process

I realised almost immediately that I would get into a natural creative flow while listening to music, and the way I'd approach a painting heavily depended on the music or movie playing in the background. I started with watercolour paints and gouache, then pastels took over and now I'm going through an acrylic and pencil phase. Through all of these phases, my works are always accompanied by the zone I'm in as I dip into a musical phase, a genre, a composer, a new album. 

It is really only about the process. I choose which sounds are going to accompany my painting session, reach out for a colour that works in that moment and starting moving around the canvas or paper. There is no plan because music can be so moody, albums have many flavours, composers change their colours during different phases of their lives. 

The process of painting creates a space for me to be closer to myself by being involved with music without all of the technical constraints and expectations. Getting closer to colour and movement, and being present and connected for a block of time is so refreshing, since most things (except for teaching) seem to divide my attention into many little different pieces.
